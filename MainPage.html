    <p>The exact date of establishment of the town is not known. Sambir, known in Polish as Sambor, was for the first time mentioned in documents in 1378. At that time, it was a private town of the noble Herburt family, part of Przemysl Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship, Kingdom of Poland. In 1501, a Roman Catholic church was opened here, and in 1553, Sambir received a town charter. In 1668, a town hall was built here, and in the early 18th century, the local church was remodelled. Until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), Sambir belonged to Przemysl Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship. From 1772 until late 1918, Sambir belonged to Austrian Galicia. In 1880, its population was 3,482, with 1,399 Greek-Catholics, 704 Roman Catholics, and 1,377 Jews.</p>

    <p>Following the Polish-Ukrainian War, Sambir was ceded to Poland by the Soviet Russia in the Peace of Riga. According to the 1921 census, the town had a population of 4,314, with 1,534 Jews. In the Second Polish Republic, it was the seat of a county in Lwow Voivodeship (until 1932). After the 1939 invasion of Poland, the town was annexed into the Soviet Union. Its Jewish residents were murdered in the Holocaust.</p>

    In the immediate postwar period, the remaining ethnic Poles were expelled. Most of them settled in the Recovered Territories. Ukrainians were resettled following Operation Vistula.
