   <h2>Windmills</h2> 
    <p>In February 2015, the first wind power plant in western Ukraine, the construction of which was held within the framework of the project "Wind of the Carpathians", was launched.</p>

    <p>The opening of the first stage of the "Staryi Sambir-1" wind farm was held on February 19. The project was implemented jointly with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank's Clean Technology Fund (SB), the Eco-Optima LLC was the contractor of construction.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>The power of the power plant is 6.6 MW. The cost of the first stage of construction was 13 million euros. On the 1st turn of the wind power station "Staryi Sambir-1" two wind turbines of firm Vestas of type V-112-3,3 with the nominal capacity of 3.3 MW are installed. Technologically, it is the most advanced turbine, its lifetime is 20 years.</p>

  <p>In 2015, two windmills produced 14.5 million kWh of electricity. For example, the Starosambirsky district consumes about 60-70 million kilowatt hours per year. The construction of new wind turbines will enable the complete supply of electricity not only to Starosambirsky but also to the neighboring Turka district, provided that each turbine produces about 1 million kWh per month.</p>

  <p>In November 2016, the construction of two more windmills was completed, with plans to build another six windmills of a newer model. - The total cost of the project is EUR 20.5 million. The height of the wind turbine mast - 119 m, the length of the blade - 56 m. Estimated life - 20 years. Through the light that produces four windmills, the whole area can already be illuminated. </p>

  <p>Unfortunately, wind power does not go to the needs of the district. Electricity is transmitted along the line of 35 kV and falls into the general energy system of Lviv region, and therefore it is difficult to determine who exactly consumes electricity from the wind farm "Old Sambir-1". "According to the legislation of Ukraine, we sell all the electricity we receive to the wholesale electricity market - SE" Energorynok ". Perhaps, certain changes will take place in 2017, when the company will be able to enter into direct contracts.</p>
