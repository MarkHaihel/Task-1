    <p>The cemetery originated in the middle of the XVI century. They hid in it inhabitants of the Staryi Sambir of Jewish nationality. Once in the city there was a fairly large and flourishing Jewish community, whose members were mainly engaged in trade. In the city they had their own stores, small industrial enterprises, and built a synagogue (see the Synagogue of Starosibirsk). The community existed for over 400 years and was destroyed by Nazi invaders during the Second World War.</p>

    The cemetery was restored in 1998-2001 on the initiative and at the expense of the birth of the Staryi Sambir Jack Gardner. About 900 tombstones have been restored, some of them are 200-300 years old. The cemetery separated from the road by a low wall. In addition, at the entrance was erected a monument.
